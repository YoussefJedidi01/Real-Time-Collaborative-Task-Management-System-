Real-Time Collaborative Task Management System

A Real-Time Collaborative Task Management System that allows users to manage and track tasks collaboratively in real time using Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation). The system enables users to create, update, assign, and delete tasks while interacting with others simultaneously. This project supports both admins and regular users with different permissions.
Features

    Task Creation: Users can create tasks with a title, description, priority, status, and assignment.
    Task Assignment: Tasks can be assigned to a specific user (e.g., user1, user2), or to the user creating the task by default.
    Task Update: Users can update task details (title, description, status, assignment) but can only update their own tasks.
    Task Deletion: Users can delete their own tasks, while admins can delete any task.
    Task Viewing: Users can view only the tasks assigned to them, while admins can view all tasks.
    Search and Filter: Search for tasks by title, status, or assigned user.
    Statistics: Get task statistics, such as the count of pending, starting, and finished tasks assigned to the user.
    Task Export: Export tasks in CSV format, showing relevant task information.

Technologies

    Java: Programming language used for backend implementation.
    RMI (Remote Method Invocation): For communication between client and server over a network.
    Multithreading: Each client action (e.g., add, update, delete task) runs in its own thread on the server to ensure parallel processing.

Project Structure

    Client.java: The client-side application where users interact with the system, performing tasks like viewing, adding, and updating tasks.
    Server.java: The server-side application that handles requests from clients and manages task data.
    TaskManagerInterface.java: The interface that defines the methods for task management (e.g., addTask, updateTask, getTasks).
    TaskManagerImplement.java: The implementation of the TaskManagerInterface where the task management logic is executed.
    Task.java: The model class representing a task with details like ID, title, description, priority, status, and assignment.
    User.java: The model class representing a user with username and password for authentication.

Installation

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-management-system.git
cd task-management-system

Compile the Java files:

javac *.java

Start the server:

java Server

Run the client:

    java Client

Usage

    Login:
        The client will ask for a username and password. Default users include:
            Username: admin, Password: admin123
            Username: user1, Password: password1
            Username: user2, Password: password2
    Main Menu Options:
        View tasks assigned to the user.
        Add a new task (ensure to follow the format for assignedTo).
        Update an existing task.
        Delete a task (can only delete tasks assigned to you unless you are an admin).
        Search tasks by keyword or filter (e.g., title, status).
        Export tasks in CSV format.
        Get task statistics (tasks assigned to the user).
